# Project--ADULT-DATASET-
-- USING MICROSOFT EXCEL IN THIS PROJECT--

This project is based on the Adult dataset, originally extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 U.S. Census database. The dataset is publicly available through the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult .
It includes both categorical and numerical data, making it ideal for exploring data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.
The main objective of this dataset is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year based on various attributes such as age, education, occupation, work hours, and marital status.

This Excel project focuses on the following:

Data cleaning and preparation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualization of demographic trends
Income distribution analysis
Insights into the relationship between education, occupation, and income
This work aims to provide a clear understanding of the socioeconomic factors that influence income levels using Excel's data tools and visualization capabilities.

--USING PYTHON IN THIS PROJECT--

The project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person's income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. 
This is a binary classification problem using the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Project Agenda

Data Loading and Exploration:
Load the dataset (adult.data.csv).
Inspect structure, column types, and summary statistics.

Data Cleaning:

Identify and remove duplicate records.
Handle missing values in categorical columns (workclass, occupation, native-country) by replacing them with the mode.

Data Preprocessing:

Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder to prepare the data for machine learning models.
